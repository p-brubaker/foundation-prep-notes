Lab 01B Notes Repository
<br>
Note: I took most of these notes earlier this year before Alchemy, but they are my original work. I figured I might as well include them in here to keep my notes sort of unified. They are already pretty nice notes, so I figured my time would be better served messing around with keyboard shortcuts than making an inferior copy of them.
